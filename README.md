# data-science-project

For this project we set out to learn about Machine learning and how to build basic models. This project was done with a given dataset with records of the Dutch Eredivisie League.
Given this data, we build models in order to predict an upcoming set of matches. For which we predicted the winner of each match, the score and the yellow cards.
